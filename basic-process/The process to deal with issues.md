Below are some discussion result and actions need to follow from the next sprint for the sprint/task monitoring for China Team.
 
* The story and tasks will be traced in Github xcat2/xcat-core repo. 

* In Github, new labels such as sprint1, sprint2 were created.

* Story will have EPIC label. 

* Tasks will be assigned an estimate point in the sprint plan meeting. The point mean an estimated time needed to finish the task for average skilled developer.

* The label “type:feature" is marked to issue that represent Tasks of a story.  

* The task(with “type:feature" label) have sprint1 or sprint2 label marked, as well as a specified Milestone.

* The issue need to be fixed in a sprint shall have both Milestone assigned and sprint* label marked.

* For long term supporting stories such as OpenBMC support, the story tile will be in the format: [OPENBMC_SUPPORT]<EPIC name>(The EPIC name simply show what will do in this sprint)

* The planed story and tasks are got from wishlist or backlog. ==> TODO

   Currently, the following source I can think our to get the task to do:

    * the CRL feature list for 2017

    * the opening issues, PMRs

    * the requirement from maillist or github, we shall judge the priority
