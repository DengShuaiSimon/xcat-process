Below are some discussion result and actions need to follow from the next sprint for the sprint/task monitoring for China Team.
 
* Provide xcat dev wish list

* The backlog list shall be started to prepare at last Friday of a sprint, ready before the next sprint plan meeting

* For the sprint plan meeting, devide it into 2 part:

    * In the morning, prepare the story, task and acceptance
 
    * In the afternoon, break down the story, task with small group. Once breakdown, pls @ related dev to review.

* The story and tasks will be traced in Github `xcat2/xcat-core` repo. 

* Story will have `EPIC` label. 

* Tasks will be assigned an `estimate point` in the sprint plan meeting. The point mean an estimated time needed to finish the task for average skilled developer.

* The label `type:feature`, `sprint1 or sprint2` and specified `Milestone` will be set to issue that represent Tasks of a story.

* For long term supporting stories such as OpenBMC support, the story tile will be in the format: [OPENBMC_SUPPORT]<EPIC name>(The EPIC name simply show what will do in this sprint)

* The planed story and tasks are got from wishlist or backlog. ==> TODO

   Currently, the following source I can think our to get the task to do:

    * the CORAL feature list for 2017

    * the opening issues, PMRs

    * the requirement from maillist or github, we shall judge the priority
    
* For issue need to be fixed in a sprint, it shall have `sprint1 or sprint2` and specified `Milestone` set.
