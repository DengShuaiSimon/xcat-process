    * SN and CN discovery and deployment
        * SN based on Mid switch

* The refinement of xCAT interfaces, make the deploy process easier for user ==>TBD
   * refine go-xcat to include xcat configuration, and use xcatprobe to check it.
   * copycds
   * node definition ==> add makehosts, makedns in the end of mkdef/chdef
   * enhance rinstall ==> able to work based on limited attributes, such as bmc, ip, mac.
